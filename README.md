# Task Overview
You are working with a FastAPI microservice structured with routers that exposes a file download endpoint, protected by a custom authentication dependency. Users are experiencing unpredictable 401 responses even with freshly issued tokens, resulting in unreliable access to protected endpoints.

# Guidance
- Review the authentication dependency that processes the bearer token.
- Check for inconsistent token storage, usage, or caching that could affect validation across different API requests or processes.
- Ensure the logic is production-ready and robust for containerized (Docker) deployment.
- Consider stateless authentication design and potential pitfalls when using custom token storage in microservices or containerized setups.

# Objectives
- Diagnose and resolve the root cause of sporadic 401 Unauthorized errors for valid, non-expired tokens.
- Ensure that the authentication logic reliably permits all valid, freshly issued tokens to access the /files/download endpoint.
- Update the authentication dependency for consistent, production-grade behavior in a Dockerized environment.

# How to Verify
- Run the application in Docker and acquire a valid token using the intended issue method.
- Access the /files/download endpoint repeatedly using the valid token and confirm that it works every time without unexpected 401 responses.
- Confirm that expired or invalid tokens are still rejected as expected.
